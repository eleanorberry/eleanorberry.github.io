            <p>This is it, the view that draws so many visitors to Petra. Completely carved out of the sandstone mountains, the Treasury was built as a tomb for the Nabataean King Aretas III. The Treasury is the highlight of Petra, but this is only really the start of a visit here. There is so much more to see.</p>
      
<h3>The Monastry</h3>

<p>The hike to the Monastery has visitors climbing over 800 steps for a solid 20 minutes or more of hiking. It is an almost entirely uphill journey. Along the way visitors pass numerous stalls, worked by women, selling scarves, souvenirs, and jewelry.</p>
       
<h3>The Tombs</h3>

<p>Here are tombs and houses built into the sandstone mountains by the Nabataeans 2000 years ago. 

Overlooking the center of Petra rise majestically the so-called "Royal Tombs," a series of large mausoleums with impressive facades hewn from the western slope of the Jabal al-Khubtha rock massif.
    
It is not possible to associate them to particular Nabataean rulers, due to the lack archaeological evidence. But recent research seems to confirm their royal context. Surveys of the North-East Petra Project (NEPP) on a hill in front of al-Khubtha, postulate the area between the Wadi Musa and Wadi Mataha as the royal quarters of the Nabataean capital, where the monumental Palace Tomb could have served as "the tomb or heroon of the kings of Petra"</p>
        

        
<h3>The Ampitheatre</h3>

Seven stairways ascend the auditorium and it can accommodate 4000 spectators. the monument was carved in the the mountainside during the reign of King Aretas IV (4BC-AD27) the Romans rebuilt the stage back wall.</p>
